# Built for a Job Application

This app showcases some of the skills I've developed as a front-end developer. It was built with React and features React hooks (eg. useState and useEffect). It's also built with Bootstrap 5, so the css has a very clean look and includes a BootStrap component, the dropdowns.

Data is fetched using Axios and asynchronously loads.

TODO:

-  configure useEffect cleanup hook (network requests are continually run once the app is loaded)
