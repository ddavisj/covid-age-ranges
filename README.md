# Covid Age Ranges Application

This app showcases some of the skills I've developed as a front-end developer. It was built with React and features React hooks (eg. useState and useEffect). It's also built with Bootstrap 5, so the styling is very clean and modern. It also includes a BootStrap React component, dropdowns.

Data is fetched using Axios and loads asynchronously.

To Do:

-  configure useEffect cleanup hook (network requests are continually run once the app is loaded)
